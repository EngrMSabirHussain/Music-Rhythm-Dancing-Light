## Project Title
# Music-Rhythm-Dancing-Light
In this project we are going to show you how to make Music Rhythm Operated Dancing Light using LEDs &amp; Transistors. You might have seen the Disco Lights or DJ lights or light during a function that turn ON and OFF according to the beats or Rhythm of the music. This Music Rhythm Operated Dancing Light circuit is based on transistor BC547.  These lights turn ON &amp; OFF according to the length and pitch of music beats or rhythm. Basically these are designed to pick the high intensity sound like Bass sound. So these lights follow the high pitch beats in music like drum beats, and Turn ON and OFF according to music pattern.


## Circuit Diagram:

Assemble the circuit on breadboard as per the circuit diagram.
